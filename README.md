# Massive JS Client

[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

Welcome to the official JS client library for the [Massive](https://massive.com/) REST and WebSocket API. To get started, please see the [Getting Started](https://massive.com/docs/stocks/getting-started) section in our documentation, view the [examples](./examples/) directory for code snippets, or the [blog post](https://massive.com/blog/javascript-stock-market-data/) with video tutorials to learn more. To generate the package documentation please run `npm run generate-doc`.

For upgrade instructions please see the [Release Notes](./CHANGELOG.md).

**Note:** Polygon.io has rebranded as [Massive.com](https://massive.com) on Oct 30, 2025. Existing API keys, accounts, and integrations continue to work exactly as before. The only change in this SDK is that it now defaults to the new API base at `api.massive.com`, while `api.polygon.io` remains supported for an extended period.

For details, see our [rebrand announcement blog post](https://massive.com/blog/polygon-is-now-massive/) or open an issue / contact [support@massive.com](mailto:support@massive.com) if you have questions.

## Getting the client

To get started, you'll need to install the client library:

```bash
npm install --save '@massive.com/client-js'
```

Next, create a new client with your [API key](https://massive.com/dashboard/signup).

```javascript
import { restClient } from '@massive.com/client-js';
const rest = restClient(process.env.POLY_API_KEY);
```

## Using the client

After creating the client, making calls to the Massive API is easy. For example, here's how to get aggregates (bars):

```javascript
rest.getStocksAggregates("AAPL", 1, GetStocksAggregatesTimespanEnum.Day, "2023-01-01", "2023-04-14").then((response) => {
	console.log(response);
}).catch(e => {
	console.error('An error happened:', e);
});
```

Or, maybe you want to get the last trades or quotes for a ticker:

```javascript
// last trade
rest.getLastStocksTrade("AAPL").then((response) => {
	console.log(response);
}).catch(e => {
	console.error('An error happened:', e);
});

// last quote (NBBO)
rest.getLastStocksQuote("AAPL").then((response) => {
	console.log(response);
}).catch(e => {
	console.error('An error happened:', e);
});
```

Finally, maybe you want a market-wide snapshot of all tickers:

```javascript
rest.getSnapshots().then((response) => {
	console.log(response);
}).catch(e => {
	console.error('An error happened:', e);
});
```

See [full examples](./examples/rest/) for more details on how to use this client effectively. 

## Pagination

The client can handle pagination for you through the `globalFetchOptions` by turning on the `pagination: true` option. The feature will automatically fetch all `next_url` pages of data when the API response indicates more data is available.

```javascript
import { restClient } from '@massive.com/client-js';

const globalFetchOptions = {
	pagination: true,
};
const rest = restClient(process.env.POLY_API_KEY, "https://api.massive.com", globalFetchOptions);

rest.getStocksAggregates("AAPL", 1, GetStocksAggregatesTimespanEnum.Day, "2023-01-01", "2023-04-14").then((response) => {
	const data = response.data; // convert axios-wrapped response
	const resultCount = data.resultsCount;
	console.log("Result count:", resultCount);
}).catch(e => {
	console.error('An error happened:', e);
});
```

If there is a `next_url` field in the API response, the client will recursively fetch the next page for you, and then pass along the accumulated data.

## WebSocket Client

Import the [Websocket](https://massive.com/docs/stocks/ws_getting-started) client and models packages to get started. You can get preauthenticated [websocket clients](https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket) for the 3 topics.

```javascript
import { websocketClient } from "@massive.com/client-js";
const stocksWS = websocketClient(process.env.POLY_API_KEY, 'wss://delayed.massive.com').stocks();

stocksWS.onmessage = ({response}) => {
  const [message] = JSON.parse(response);

  stocksWS.send('{"action":"subscribe", "params":"AM.MSFT,A.MSFT"}');

  switch (message.ev) {
    case "AM":
      // your trade message handler
      break;
    case "A":
      // your trade message handler
      break;
  }
};

stocksWS.send({ action: "subscribe", params: "T.MSFT" });
```
See [full examples](./examples/websocket/) for more details on how to use this client effectively.
