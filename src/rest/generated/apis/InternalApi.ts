The taxonomy is created by reviewing related 10K filings to create a set of structured categories and tags. <br /> <br /> The categories are based on company operating models and are industry agnostic. Our current version only supports one category, Revenue Streams, with future plans to support more. <br /> <br /> The tags define a specific type within the category.
